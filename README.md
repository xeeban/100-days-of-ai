# 100 Days of AI

This repository documents my journey through a 100-day hands-on exploration of artificial intelligence, where I'm using AI daily for real work and sharing what I learn along the way.

## About This Challenge

Rather than passively consuming content about AI, I'm actively experimenting with AI tools and embedding them authentically into my daily life. The goal is to explore how AI can serve as "power armor" to accomplish my goals while maintaining what makes me uniquely human—enriching the journey itself rather than rushing toward efficiency.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains projects, experiments, and code generated during the challenge. Each project includes documentation of the process, tools used, and lessons learned.

### PROMPT-XX.md Files

Throughout this challenge, I'm documenting the prompts used to generate code with AI tools like Claude Code. These `PROMPT-XX.md` files serve as:
- A record of the creative process with AI assistance
- Examples of effective prompt engineering
- Transparency about how AI tools were used in development
- Learning resources for others exploring AI-assisted development

Each PROMPT file captures the initial instructions given to the AI, providing insight into how complex applications can be built through natural language interaction with AI development tools.

## Projects

### Coursera Claude Code Course
Located in `coursera-claude-code/`, this directory contains projects built while learning to use Claude Code effectively:
- **expense-tracker-ai** - A full-featured expense tracking web application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
  - See [PROMPT-01.md](coursera-claude-code/expense-tracker-ai/PROMPT-01.md) for the original prompt

## About Me
